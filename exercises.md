# Questions

## What type of writing do you do?
Poetry, non-fiction, memoir, criticism

## What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
MS word, notes app, Scrivener, paper!

## How do these tools shape the what you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?
I find Word pretty constraining at times when it comes to my poetry — it isn’t always the most cooperative when I want to experiment with line breaks, more abstract formatting, and I'm often hindered by spell check/auto-corrective features (e.g. capitalisation). Obviously, these features are very useful when I’m writing prose, so it’s kind of a trade-off! My notes app(s) are very useful for writing snippets of poetry and prose on the go (although my notes are scattered/numerous and can easily get a bit buried…) but again, limits any kind of creative formatting/enjambment.
