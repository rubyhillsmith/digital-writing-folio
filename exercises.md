# Questions

## Week 1

### What type of writing do you do?
Poetry, non-fiction, memoir, criticism

### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
MS word, notes app, Scrivener, paper!

### How do these tools shape the what you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?
I find Word pretty constraining at times when it comes to my poetry — it isn’t always the most cooperative when I want to experiment with line breaks, more abstract formatting, and I'm often hindered by spell check/auto-corrective features (e.g. unwanted capitalisation). Obviously, these features are very useful when I’m writing traditional prose, so it’s kind of a trade-off! My notes app(s) are very useful for writing snippets of poetry and prose on the go (although my notes are scattered/numerous and can easily get a bit buried…) but again, limits any kind of creative formatting/enjambment. 

## Week 2

### How is electronic literature different from print literature? 

Electronic literature is to be created/read on an electronic device (computer, phone). Print literature can be read/created on an electronic device, but an electronic device is not essential to its creation/consumption (though obviously it’s often more convenient to create print literature using electronic word processors). There is a long history of print literature, while electronic literature is fairly new and still developing. The technology used to create electronic literature opens up a variety of possibilities for form and formatting, some of which can’t be replicated in print literature — e.g. the use of hyperlinks or cursor movements to propel a story forward — which in turn affects the narrative structure of electronic literature, the characterisation, the tone. In this sense, if one were to translate/transform a print literature story into an electronic literature format (while retaining the same characters/narrative), it may produce an entirely different effect / response from the reader. ‘You have to do more than turn the page in order to experience it’. 

### What are some of the qualities of electronic literature? 

Interactive, pre-programmed, experimental, diverse in style, sometimes non-linear, sometimes collaborative, sometimes have audio qualities, sometimes ephemeral/hard to capture or re-capture (if you were to show the work to a friend, they mightn’t be able to replicate the experience you had when you first interacted with it on your own), sometimes glitchy, point-of-view, sometimes second-person (which is relatively rare in print). Issues with accessibility. The quality of infiniteness — not every electronic work ends, and this can make electronic works intimidating/frustrating. 

### Responses to 'Snowball', a remix of 'Taroko Gorge'

https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/snowball/

### What aspects of the remix are the same? What aspects of the remix are different?

Alireza Mahzoon’s remix is called Snowball. Like Taroko Gorge, the poem describes a natural scene through variations of generated text (drawn from a limited pool of words). Both poems are abstract and evocative. The text in the remix scrolls pretty quickly — moving at a much faster pace to the original Taroko Gorge. Sometimes I found it hard to keep up with Snowball’s text as it moved, forcing me to focus more on Mahzoon’s individual word choices and use of repetition than on the poem’s longer phrases/couplets. 

### Is the remix successful (why or why not)?

I think it was partially successful, though I didn't enjoy it as much as Taroko Gorge. I’m used to taking my time when I read poems, so having to contend with such a fast-moving poem on this incredibly micro level put me off at first. Maybe the scrolling speed (combined with the bright white text) is supposed to evoke heavy snowfall? In some ways it’s an interesting and valuable exercise — being forced to focus on one or two words at a time rather than processing them within the broader context of entire phrases or stanzas. While I enjoyed the poem’s imagery at first, I soon became frustrated that it drew from such a small pool of words. Mahzoon uses an image of code as a backdrop to the poem, which contrasts with the poem’s organic/human imagery — this is a playful, intriguing choice. 

## Week 3

### To Make a Dadaist Poem Remix

My remix is based on this [New York Post article](https://nypost.com/2022/03/06/wonder-of-the-seas-cruise-ship-sets-sail-for-first-time/) about an enormous cruise ship.
