# Questions

## Week 1

### What type of writing do you do?
Poetry, non-fiction, memoir, criticism

### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
MS word, notes app, Scrivener, paper!

### How do these tools shape the what you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?
I find Word pretty constraining at times when it comes to my poetry — it isn’t always the most cooperative when I want to experiment with line breaks, more abstract formatting, and I'm often hindered by spell check/auto-corrective features (e.g. unwanted capitalisation). Obviously, these features are very useful when I’m writing traditional prose, so it’s kind of a trade-off! My notes app(s) are very useful for writing snippets of poetry and prose on the go (although my notes are scattered/numerous and can easily get a bit buried…) but again, limits any kind of creative formatting/enjambment. 

## Week 2

### How is electronic literature different from print literature? 

Electronic literature is to be created/read on an electronic device (computer, phone) — print literature can be read/created on an electronic device, but an electronic device is not essential to its creation/consumption (though obviously it’s often more convenient to create print literature using electronic word processors). There is a long history of print literature, while electronic literature is fairly new and still developing. The technology used to create electronic literature opens up a variety of possibilities for form and formatting, some of which can’t be replicated in print literature — e.g. the use of hyperlinks or cursor movements to propel a story forward — which in turn affects the narrative structure of electronic literature, the characterisation, the tone. In this sense, if one were to translate/transform a print literature story into an electronic literature format (while retaining the same characters/narrative), it may produce an entirely different effect / response from the reader. ‘You have to do more than turn the page in order to experience it’. 

### What are some of the qualities of electronic literature? 

Interactive, pre-programmed, experimental, diverse in style, sometimes non-linear, sometimes collaborative, sometimes have audio qualities, sometimes ephemeral/hard to capture or re-capture (if you were to show the work to a friend, they mightn’t be able to replicate the experience you had when you first interacted with it on your own), sometimes glitchy, point-of-view, sometimes second-person (which is relatively rare in print). Issues with accessibility. The quality of infiniteness — not every electronic work ends, and this can make electronic works intimidating/frustrating.
