# Questions

## Week 1

### What type of writing do you do?
Poetry, non-fiction, memoir, criticism

### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
MS word, notes app, Scrivener, paper!

### How do these tools shape the what you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?
I find Word pretty constraining at times when it comes to my poetry — it isn’t always the most cooperative when I want to experiment with line breaks, more abstract formatting, and I'm often hindered by spell check/auto-corrective features (e.g. unwanted capitalisation). Obviously, these features are very useful when I’m writing traditional prose, so it’s kind of a trade-off! My notes app(s) are very useful for writing snippets of poetry and prose on the go (although my notes are scattered/numerous and can easily get a bit buried…) but again, limits any kind of creative formatting/enjambment. 

## Week 2

### How is electronic literature different from print literature? 

Electronic literature is to be created/read on an electronic device (computer, phone). Print literature can be read/created on an electronic device, but an electronic device is not essential to its creation/consumption (though obviously it’s often more convenient to create print literature using electronic word processors). There is a long history of print literature, while electronic literature is fairly new and still developing. The technology used to create electronic literature opens up a variety of possibilities for form and formatting, some of which can’t be replicated in print literature — e.g. the use of hyperlinks or cursor movements to propel a story forward — which in turn affects the narrative structure of electronic literature, the characterisation, the tone. In this sense, if one were to translate/transform a print literature story into an electronic literature format (while retaining the same characters/narrative), it may produce an entirely different effect / response from the reader. ‘You have to do more than turn the page in order to experience it’. 

### What are some of the qualities of electronic literature? 

Interactive, pre-programmed, experimental, diverse in style, sometimes non-linear, sometimes collaborative, sometimes have audio qualities, sometimes ephemeral/hard to capture or re-capture (if you were to show the work to a friend, they mightn’t be able to replicate the experience you had when you first interacted with it on your own), sometimes glitchy, point-of-view, sometimes second-person (which is relatively rare in print). Issues with accessibility. The quality of infiniteness — not every electronic work ends, and this can make electronic works intimidating/frustrating. 

### Responses to 'Snowball', a remix of 'Taroko Gorge'

https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/snowball/

### What aspects of the remix are the same? What aspects of the remix are different?

Alireza Mahzoon’s remix is called Snowball. Like Taroko Gorge, the poem describes a natural scene through variations of generated text (drawn from a limited pool of words). Both poems are abstract and evocative. The text in the remix scrolls pretty quickly — moving at a much faster pace to the original Taroko Gorge. Sometimes I found it hard to keep up with Snowball’s text as it moved, forcing me to focus more on Mahzoon’s individual word choices and use of repetition than on the poem’s longer phrases/couplets. 

### Is the remix successful (why or why not)?

I think it was partially successful, though I didn't enjoy it as much as Taroko Gorge. I’m used to taking my time when I read poems, so having to contend with such a fast-moving poem on this incredibly micro level put me off at first. Maybe the scrolling speed (combined with the bright white text) is supposed to evoke heavy snowfall? In some ways it’s an interesting and valuable exercise — being forced to focus on one or two words at a time rather than processing them within the broader context of entire phrases or stanzas. While I enjoyed the poem’s imagery at first, I soon became frustrated that it drew from such a small pool of words. Mahzoon uses an image of code as a backdrop to the poem, which contrasts with the poem’s organic/human imagery — this is a playful, intriguing choice. 

### To Make a Dadaist Poem Remix

My remix is based on this [New York Post article](https://nypost.com/2022/03/06/wonder-of-the-seas-cruise-ship-sets-sail-for-first-time/) about an enormous cruise ship.

This was a really fun exercise — taking a paper-based writing experiment from the 1920s into the digital realm. This exercise, alongside many of the other discussions we had in class, proved that some of the key themes/hallmarks of electronic literature (randomisation, reshuffling, ‘infiniteness’) have been around for a long time, particularly in the work of experimental writers. I liked that the act of reshuffling this particular poem (through the click of a button) was more immediate than Tzara’s method, though I wonder if we miss out on a key part of the artistic process by skipping steps 5-8. This exercise was an effective but relatively simple way for us to expand our understanding of the mechanics of Glitch, too.

## Week 4

### We Walk to You Remix, 'Hurry Up'

https://lapis-scarlet-light.glitch.me

I enjoyed remixing We Walk to You into a poem of my own, Hurry Up. It was empowering to learn how to make some basic alterations to the original code in Glitch (colour, font, text) and to see them instantly reflected in the preview panel. The element of movement in the poem is simple yet effective — it really defines the way the reader interacts with the poem. Because of this, my remix thematically riffs on the idea of speed. This exercise influenced me to include an element of movement in my major project, but perhaps in a way that is more mechanical/controlled by the reader.

## Week 5

### First Twine Experiment, 'Holiday Rooms'

Here is the FIRST iteration of my Twine experiment, Holiday Rooms. I’ve already decided that I want to go down more of a customisable route with my major project (likely a website), especially given that I’m working with poetry, but I can really see the appeal of Twine. It’s fun to think about the possibilities of a program like this that allows you to break up your work into multiple, linked sections. I don’t really write fiction, but I can imagine using Twine for a creative non-fiction project, particularly one that has lots of interesting asides, footnotes or references that you could house in different ‘rooms’. It was fun to mess around with the program today, creating a simple and silly Twine experiment that takes the reader through rooms based on different holidays. 

## Week 6

### Edited Twine Experiment: Styles and Linked Image

This week I fixed my Twine experiment and added styles and a linked image, [Holiday Rooms](https://unique-capybara-c87415.netlify.app/)

For whatever reason, last week’s iteration of Holiday Rooms kept on breaking / failing to update, so I had to create a replica (linked here). This one works! This week we added styles and a linked image. It was hard to keep up with Ben’s instructions at times, but this also encouraged me to let go and focus on the technical side of things — putting aside the quality of my story and the ugliness of my font choices, etc. 

### Bitsy Game 'Poetry Quest'

This week I also created a Bitsy game called [Poetry Quest](https://benevolent-biscuit-fbf4c2.netlify.app/)

I love the retro aesthetic of Bitsy, and it was a nice change to create a game that involved interactive elements like a moving avatar and talking ‘sprites’. Again, as someone who doesn’t really write fiction, I had to think creatively about how I might incorporate this program into my own writing practice, especially with its focus on dialogue…but I think you could design a fun Bitsy where each interaction with an in-game object reveals a line of poetry. Players could encounter these objects as they see fit, creating a unique/randomised poem. Perhaps this is something I’ll explore in the future. 

## Week 9

### Edited Twine Experiment: Audio

This week I added audio to the final page of my Twine experiment, [Holiday Rooms](https://unique-capybara-c87415.netlify.app/)

As much as Twine frustrates me (or frustrates my computer, I can’t tell), I like that we’ve revisited our experiments multiple times. This has helped to cement the program’s step-by-step processes into my memory, as even getting the hang of deploying my projects has taken time. Basically, I appreciate the repetition! This week we downloaded audio from the BBC Sound Effects website to add to our Twine experiment. I couldn’t find an audio clip that was perfect for Holiday Rooms (in length, in theme), so I chose something a bit absurd instead. One of my main takeaways was that it would be useful to learn how to edit audio if I ever wanted to use it in a more complex work of electronic literature. 

## Week 10

### Edited Twine Experiment: Background Image

This week I added a spooky background image to my Twine experiment, [Holiday Rooms](https://unique-capybara-c87415.netlify.app/)

This background image is probably my favourite addition to my silly Twine experiment — it certainly adds to the atmosphere. Recently, I’ve been spending most of my time on my poetry website, so Holiday Rooms is still pretty basic, but I’m pleased to have some rudimentary Twine skills to help me work with the program in the future — likely for an experimental non-fic project, as I mentioned a few weeks ago. Despite the (multiple) technological hitches along the way, Twine has definitely won me over.
